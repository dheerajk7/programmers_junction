    <h1 style="color:blue">Operator</h1>
    <p>Operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.
Consider the expression 4 + 5 = 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator.
</p>
    <h2 style="color:chocolate">Types of Operator</h2>
    <p>Python language supports the following types of operators.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Arithmetic Operators</li>
        <li>Comparison (Relational) Operators</li>
        <li>Assignment Operators</li>
        <li>Logical Operators</li>
        <li>Bitwise Operators</li>
        <li>Membership Operators</li>
        <li>Identity Operators</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let us hav3e a look on all operators one by one.</p>

    <p>These operators compare the values on either sides of them and decide the relation among them. They are also called Relational operators.
